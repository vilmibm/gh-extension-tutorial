# GitHub APIs

GitHub has two APIs: REST and GraphQL. Both are commonly used and the `go-gh` library can help you call both of them. In general, the REST API is much easier to understand and work with and is a good place to start with any project. The GraphQL API is more cumbersome and confusing, but can yield much better performance.

## Calling the REST API for a list of issues

Since the REST API is more straightforward we'll start there.

Add code to the end of `runSpam` (after the argument processing):

```go
func runSpam(cmd *cobra.Command, repo repository.Repository, args []string) (err error) {
  // ... argument processing ...

  client, err := api.DefaultRESTClient()
  if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("couldn't create client: %w", err)
  }

  path := fmt.Sprintf("repos/%s/%s/issues?per_page=100", repo.Owner, repo.Name)

  response := []struct {
    Number int
  }{}

  err = client.Get(path, &response)
  if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to call API: %w", err)
  }

  fmt.Printf("found %d issues. gonna comment on one\n", len(response))

  return
}
```

**!!!** Your editor is probably adding to the import list at the top for you. If you are getting compilation errors, however, manually add `"github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/api"` to the import list at the top of `main.go`.

## Commenting and closing with REST

We used `Get` to grab our issues; let's next pick a random one to comment on and use `Post` to make a comment.

Replace the `fmt.Println` at the end of `runSpam` with:

```go
func runSpam(cmd *cobra.Command, repo repository.Repository, args []string) (err error) {
  // ... flag processing, Get call...

  if len(response) == 0 {
    return fmt.Errorf("no issues to choose from in %s/%s", repo.Owner, repo.Name)
  }
  
  rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())
  choice := response[rand.Intn(len(response))].Number
  
  path = fmt.Sprintf("repos/%s/%s/issues/%d/comments", repo.Owner, repo.Name, choice)
  
  body := map[string]string{
    "body": message,
  }
  
  bodyJSON, _ := json.Marshal(body)
  
  if err = client.Post(path, bytes.NewReader(bodyJSON), nil); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to call API: %w", err)
  }
  
  path = fmt.Sprintf("repos/%s/%s/issues/%d", repo.Owner, repo.Name, choice)
  
  body = map[string]string{
    "state": "closed",
  }
  
  bodyJSON, _ = json.Marshal(body)
  
  if err = client.Patch(path, bytes.NewReader(bodyJSON), nil); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to call API: %w", err)
  }
  
  fmt.Printf("Closed #%d with '%s'\n", choice, message)
  
  return
}
```

**!!!** Your editor is probably adding to the import list at the top for you. If you are getting compilation errors, however, make sure your import list looks like this:

```go
import (
  "bytes"
  "encoding/json"
  "fmt"
  "math/rand"
  "os"
  "time"

  "github.com/AlecAivazis/survey/v2"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/api"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/repository"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/term"
  "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)
```

This actually concludes `gh lol spam`. Try running it!

```bash
go build
gh lol spam -R vilmibm/testing "howdy partner"
```

Please do spam my testing repository (no really, it would delight me).

## Calling the GraphQL API

For `gh lol yell` we want a list of issues to yell about. We could technically use REST for this, but GraphQL makes it easier to get exactly what we want. If we were to use the REST endpoint to get issues, we'd have to manually filter our pull requests. Take a deep breath, think of something relaxing like a sunset or sleeping kitten, and buckle a seatbelt or two. It's time to add some GraphQL.

First, let's grab a library that will help us interact with GraphQL:

```bash
go get github.com/cli/shurcooL-graphql
```

and import it at the top of `main.go`. The import list should look like:

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/AlecAivazis/survey/v2"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/api"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/repository"
  graphql "github.com/cli/shurcooL-graphql"
  "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)
```

**!!!** Note that we _aliased_ the graphql import. This is necessary because we on the CLI team forked the `shurcooL/graphql` library.

Next, add this code to the bottom of `runYell` after the flag processing:

```go
func runYell(cmd *cobra.Command, repo repository.Repository) (err error) {
  // ... flag processing ...

  client, err := api.DefaultGraphQLClient()
  if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("couldn't make client: %w", err)
  }

  var query struct {
    Repository struct {
      Issues struct {
        Nodes []struct {
          Title  string
          Number int
        }
      } `graphql:"issues(first: 25, states: [OPEN])"`
    } `graphql:"repository(owner: $owner, name: $name)"`
  }

  variables := map[string]interface{}{
    "owner": graphql.String(repo.Owner),
    "name":  graphql.String(repo.Name),
  }

  if err = client.Query("Issues", &query, variables); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to call API: %w", err)
  }
  for _, i := range query.Repository.Issues.Nodes {
    fmt.Println(i.Number, i.Title)
  }

  return
}
```

That's all the GraphQL we'll need. We will finish doing the output for this command in the next chapter. If you want, though, you can run your extension to see the GraphQL in action:

```go
go build
gh lol yell --loud 1 -R vilmibm/testing
```

It should print a rough list of issues from `vilmibm/testing`.
