# Prerequisites

Before we get going with this guide, it's important to make sure the right things are in place for developing extensions. Otherwise it's like telling you how great a mouth watering recipe is only for you to find out that it requires ingredients you have to fly to another country to get.

## Get gh installed and authenticated

If you already have `gh` installed and authenticated, feel free to zone out for this part.

```
# MacOS
brew install gh

# Windows
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

If you're on Linux, check out our [linux installation docs](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md).

Once installed, authenticate `gh`:

```
# Start the authentication wizard
gh auth login
```

and then test it out:

```
gh api graphql -fquery='query { viewer { login } }'
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "login": "vilmibm"
    }
  }
}
```

## Installing go

If you already have `go` installed (1.21 or newer), feel free to skip this part.

Head to [the Go downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/). Download and run the appropriate installation media.

**_!!!_** You may need to close and re-open any terminals you have open for `go` to be added to your path depending on your operating system.

### Verify that the installation worked

Create a new file somewhere called `main.go` with the contents:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("oh hey")

}
```

Try running the file:

```
go run ./main.go

oh hey
```
