# Output Formatting

We've finished one command; now it's time to finish `gh yell` too.

This chapter is about using the `TablePrinter` in `go-gh`. It's used in `gh` itself to generate all the output for commands like `gh pr list` or `gh run list`. It's cool.

Head into `runYell` and add to the bottom, replacing the `for` loop:

```go
func runYell(cmd *cobra.Command, repo repository.Repository) (err error) {
  // ... flag processing, graphql ...
  terminal := term.FromEnv()
  termWidth, _, _ := terminal.Size()
  tp := tableprinter.New(terminal.Out(), terminal.IsTerminalOutput(), termWidth)

  cyan := func(s string) string {
    return "\x1b[36m" + s + "\x1b[m"
  }

  for _, i := range query.Repository.Issues.Nodes {
    tp.AddField(fmt.Sprintf("#%d", i.Number), tableprinter.WithColor(cyan))
    title := strings.ToUpper(i.Title)
    for x := 0; x < loud; x++ {
      title += "!"
    }
    tp.AddField(title)
    tp.EndRow()
  }

  return tp.Render()
}
```

_ !!! _ Your editor is probably keeping the import list accurate, but if you get a compilation error make sure that your import list looks like this:

```go
import (
  "bytes"
  "encoding/json"
  "fmt"
  "math/rand"
  "os"
  "time"

  "github.com/AlecAivazis/survey/v2"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/api"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/repository"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/tableprinter"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/term"
  graphql "github.com/cli/shurcooL-graphql"
  "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)
```

`gh lol yell` is now ready for action.

```bash
go build
gh lol yell -Rvilmibm/testing
```

After giving a loudness value, you should see a bunch of very loud issue titles.

Note that the color output is disabled if we pipe. Try running:

```bash
gh lol yell -Rvilmibm/testing --loud 5 | cat
```

to see for yourself. Thanks, `tableprinter`! We can also easily use this command with `cut`:

```bash
gh lol yell -Rvilmibm/testing --loud 5 | cut -f2
```

## Recap

The basic functionality for both of our extension's subcommands is complete. We'll be returning to this code one last time, however, to support some extension-specific configuration.
