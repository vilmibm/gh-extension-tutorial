# Command dispatch

## Adding cobra

`gh-lol` has multiple subcommands. It's time to bring in `cobra`. While we're fetching requirements, upgrade `go-gh` too:

Run:

```bash
go get github.com/spf13/cobra
go get github.com/cli/go-gh/v2
```

Once that's done, open up `main.go` in your editor of choice and make it look like this:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func _main() error {
  rootCmd := &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "lol <subcommand> [flags]",
    Short: "gh lol",
  }
  return rootCmd.Execute()
}

func main() {
  if err := _main(); err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "X %s", err.Error())
  }
}
```

then run:

```bash
go build
gh lol
```

You should see:

```
gh lol

```

That's `cobra` printing out automatic usage information. Since we haven't specified any flags, arguments, or subcommands yet it's pretty sparse--just the value we specified for `Short`.

## Persistent --repo flag

It is extremely common for GitHub CLI extensions to want to work on specific repositories. Almost every command in `gh` itself, for example, will try to autodetect if it's being run in a directory that in a repository hosted on GitHub in addition to respecting a `-R/--repo` flag.

Let's have `gh-lol` also support this behavior. To do this, we use a feature of `cobra` called **persistent flags**.

Back in your editor, add two lines to the list of imports:

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/repository"
  "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)
```

And then main `_main` look like this:

```go
func _main() error {
  var repo repository.Repository

  rootCmd := &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "lol <subcommand> [flags]",
    Short: "gh lol",
  }

  repoOverride := rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("repo", "R", "", "Repository to use in OWNER/REPO format")

  rootCmd.PersistentPreRunE = func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) (err error) {
    if *repoOverride != "" {
      repo, err = repository.Parse(*repoOverride)
    } else {
      repo, err = repository.Current()
    }
    return
  }
  
  return rootCmd.Execute()
}
```

**!!!** this is not going to compile! but don't worry, it will after the next step.

Now, we'll check the directory `gh lol` was run in with `repository.Current` if nothing has been passed for `repoOverride`. If no override was passed and `gh lol` was not run in a repository directory, we'll allow an error to bubble up: all of our commands need to query a repository so there would be no point in proceeding.

## Adding subcommands

Add the following to `_main` after the definition of `rootCmd.PersistentPreRunE`:

```go
// rootCmd.PersistentPreRunE = ...

spamCmd := &cobra.Command{
  Use:   "spam [<message>]",
  Short: "Comment on a random issue or pr in a repository",
  RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) (err error) {
    fmt.Printf("Gonna comment on a random thing in: %s/%s\n", repo.Owner, repo.Name)
    return
  },
}

yellCmd := &cobra.Command{
  Use:   "yell",
  Short:  "Print a list of issues loudly",
  RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) (err error) {
    fmt.Printf("Gonna list issues in: %s/%s\n", repo.Owner, repo.Name)
    return
  },
}

rootCmd.AddCommand(spamCmd)
rootCmd.AddCommand(yellCmd)
```

Now that our root command has subcommands, `gh lol` will have more interesting usage information.

Run:

```bash
go build
gh lol
```

and you should see something like:

```
gh lol

Usage:
  lol [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  spam        Add a comment to a random issue or pr in a repository
  yell        Print a list of issues loudly

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for lol
  -R, --repo string   Repository to use in OWNER/REPO format

Use "lol [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

`cobra` automatically added the `completion` and `help` subcommands for us as well as the `--help` flag. Thanks bud.

In the next chapter we'll add behavior to our two subcommands to handle user input.
